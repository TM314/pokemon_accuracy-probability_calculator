# Pokemon Accuracy/Probability Calculator

This is a calculator for determining how likely certain events are in Pokemon singles battles.

## Installation

This script requires two packages:
- PySimpleGUI
- Pokepy

To install these:

```
pip install PySimpleGUI
```

```
pip install pokepy
```

## Usage

```
python accuracy_calc.py
```

This will open a window where you'll enter the relevant information for the calculation. Any field can be left blank if not required except the move of who you want to calculate the probability for. Abilities and items that don't change accuracy don't need to be included. Stat changes should be included as +1, -4, 0 etc.

## Contributing

Feel free to use the code for your own recreational use when tilting over battles or coming up with hax sets. 

If you find any issues (there probably are, this was made pretty quickly) then please raise an issue here.
